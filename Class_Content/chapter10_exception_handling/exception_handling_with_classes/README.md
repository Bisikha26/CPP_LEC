## We can use Exception handling with class too. Even we can throw an exception of user defined class types. 
---

# For throwing an exception of say demo class type within try block we may write 

```
throw demo();
here, demo() is called nameless object of type Class
```

### Note : In C++, anonymous objects are primarily used either to pass or return values without having to create lots of temporary variables to do so.
