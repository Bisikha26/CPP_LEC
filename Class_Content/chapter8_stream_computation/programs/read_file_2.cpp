// how to open and read text from a text file character by character in C++?

// Logic
// Open file in read/input mode using std::in
// Check file exists or not, if it does not exist terminate the program
// If file exist, run a loop until EOF (end of file) not found
// Read a single character using cin in a temporary variable
// And print it on the output screen
// Close the file
