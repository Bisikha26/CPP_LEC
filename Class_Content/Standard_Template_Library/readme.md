## Standard Template Library = Containers + Algorithms + Iterators

### Containers - Object which stores data
### Algorithm - Procedure to process data
### Iterators - Object which points to an element of a Container

## The Standard Template Library (STL) is a set of C++ template classes to provide common programming data structures and functions such as lists, stacks, arrays, etc. It is a library of container classes, algorithms, and iterators. It is a generalized library and so, its components are parameterized.
